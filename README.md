# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### what it can do

https://jsonplaceholder.ir/users/{userId}
https://jsonplaceholder.ir/posts?userId={userId}
https://jsonplaceholder.ir/posts/{postId}
https://jsonplaceholder.ir/comments?postId={postId}

React app that covers the following concerns:

- Login: a modal with '/login' route. user can login using `user${userId}` as username and '123456' as password, if the user exists in its' endpoint. If the user is logged in then he should be redirected to '/posts' route.
- Posts: all posts by logged in user. User navigates to post's page by click on its' title. If the user isn't logged in then the app should blur the page and show login modal with '/login' route and after login the previous page is displayed.
- Post: display post content and comments by getting post id in url. If the user isn't logged in then the app should blur the page and show login modal with '/login' route and after login the previous page is displayed.
- Logout: user stays logged in unless the logout button is pressed and the app must consider the user as logout.
